# Bank_Consumer_Complaints
Visualizing and understanding trends in complaints received by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau

This program creates a variety of plots with data from the Consumer Complaints Database, organized by the CFPB.

Comments in the code reflect my exploratory research questions, and how the data supports or refutes my thinking.

Future commits will be aimed at running statistical models to further understand the relationships between variables.
